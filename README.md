# how-to-not-dev-java

###Hello! My name is Zemian Deng, and I am a software developer.

This project is my personal playground for Java programming. I explore many features of the JDK and other third party libraries. Some demos can be used as reference and study, while some may be used as template to jump start a new project.

See different branches for more.
